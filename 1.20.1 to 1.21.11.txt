differnce form 1.20.1 to 1.21.11

-ID,Area of Change,Old API (Pre-1.21.11),New API (1.21.11),Fix/Migration Strategy
I.1,Baked Quad Data Structure (Critical),Raw int[] BakedQuad.getVertices(),"Explicit Fields (Vector3fc positions, UVs) plus NeoForge-added BakedNormals and BakedColors.","Complete Rewrite Required: The low-level vertex data is no longer stored as an opaque int[]. Custom model loaders, model generation logic (IBakedModel implementations), and any code that manually processes quad vertex data must be rewritten to access and use the new explicit fields (positions, UVs, normals, colors) directly. This is a fundamental change to how model data is structured and accessed."
I.2,Vertex Consumer UV,"VertexConsumer.uv(float u, float v)","Methods are replaced by direct use of BakedQuad's explicit UV fields during model building, or new explicit methods in the VertexConsumer interface.","Update Rendering Logic: Instead of relying on sequential calls to generic vertex attributes, you must now use the updated methods on the VertexConsumer interface (e.g., in custom renderers or VertexConsumers) that align with the explicit data structure. Focus on methods that set all vertex attributes (position, color, UV, light, normal) in one call."
I.3,Entity Renderer Signature,"public void render($T$ entity, **float entityYaw**, float partialTicks, ...)","public abstract void render($T$ pEntity, float pPartialTicks, ...)","Remove the entityYaw parameter from all custom EntityRenderer overrides. This parameter is no longer explicitly passed in the primary render method, requiring a simple signature update for compatibility." -

II.1,Item/Block Interaction Result,InteractionResultHolder<T>,net.minecraft.world.InteractionResult.Result<T>,"Global Find/Replace: Replace all uses of the old class with the new, inner class: net.minecraft.world.InteractionResult.Result. The functionality remains the same (combining an InteractionResult with an object), but the class name and location have changed."
II.2,Command Permissions Signature,CommandSourceStack.hasPermission(int),CommandSourceStack.hasPermission(int),"No Change to Signature: The method signature remains stable. The integer value continues to represent the required permission level (e.g., 0 for everyone, 4 for server operators)."
II.3,NBT Access (Optional),"CompoundTag.getCompound(""key"") (returns object directly, or a default empty tag/value)","CompoundTag.getCompound(""key"").orElse(new CompoundTag())","Mandatory Optional Handling: Most NBT getter methods (getCompound, getList, etc.) now return an Optional<T> wrapper. You must update all calls to use .orElse(...) or .ifPresent(...) to safely retrieve the contained value or provide a default fallback, preventing potential NoSuchElementException when a tag is missing."
II.4,Component Data Storage,Generic CustomData storage for entity and block entity components.,net.minecraft.core.component.TypedEntityData,Update Components: Migrate all references and implementations that relied on the generic CustomData map to the new TypedEntityData API. This system promotes type-safety and standardizes data storage using the new Data Component framework introduced in 1.20.5/1.21. -

III.1,Resource Identifier Renaming,net.minecraft.resources.ResourceLocation,net.minecraft.resources.Identifier,Global Find/Replace: Perform a global search and replace for all class and variable references. This is a simple renaming of a core class used everywhere to uniquely identify assets and registry entries.
III.2,Player Identity (Critical),"GameProfile (used in server lists, bans, etc.)",net.minecraft.server.players.NameAndId,"Global Find/Replace: All server-side classes (e.g., ban list, op list) that previously stored or retrieved player identity using GameProfile must be updated to use the new NameAndId class, which is a stripped-down, server-specific representation of a player's name and UUID."
III.3,Reload Listener Shared State,"PreparableReloadListener#reload(ResourceManager, ...)","PreparableReloadListener#reload(SharedState, ...) + prepareSharedState","Update Interface: Implement prepareSharedState to allow data preparation across reload threads, and update the final reload method to accept and consume the new SharedState object. This refactoring improves the thread safety and efficiency of resource loading."
III.4,Nullability Annotations (Critical),javax.annotation.Nullable,org.jspecify.annotations.Nullable (JSpecify standard). Unannotated types are implicitly non-null (@NullMarked).,"Update Annotations: Migrate all usage of javax.annotation.Nullable to the JSpecify package. Crucially, due to the new implicit non-null convention, you must review your code and explicitly add @Nullable where a parameter, field, or return type can truly be null, as the compiler will now assume non-annotated types are non-null."
III.5,Spear/Projectile Combat API,Standard entity attack logic.,"New logic for Jab and Charge attacks, new minecraft:attack_range component fields, new Lunge enchantment.","Refactor Combat Logic: If your mod interacts with weapon mechanics, custom projectiles, or attack handling, you must review the new combat features. Specifically, account for the new Spear mechanics and how they utilize the new data component fields for properties like attack range."
III.6,Block Behavior Signature,BlockBehaviour#entityInside(...),"BlockBehaviour#entityInside(..., **boolean**)","Update Signatures: Add the new boolean parameter to your override of entityInside. This parameter indicates whether the entity is currently being pushed by the block, providing more context for movement logic." -
